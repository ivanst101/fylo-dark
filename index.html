                        <p class="content active" id="organisation">More organizations take advantage of the benefits of using a cloud-based file-sharing system. Cloud-based file sharing allows you to control which people can access, edit, or move the files your company stores and share those files with stakeholders in any location. This guide outlines the benefits of file sharing in the cloud to help you consider whether switching to cloud storage is best for your company.</p>
                        <p class="content" id="access">With cloud-based file sharing, files are much easier to create, edit, and share. Instead of relying on on-premises servers and IT infrastructure, companies with a cloud-based file system make their content instantly accessible to any team members who need them. Cloud file systems are accessible through the internet, allowing your people to locate and open them from any location as long as they have a computer, tablet, or phone with an internet connection.</p>
                        <p class="content" id="security">Understanding how to improve information security is critical for protecting your valuable content. The average cost of a data breach in the United States was $9.44 million in 2022, making cybersecurity a high priority for companies across industries. Hackers may use ransomware attacks and other viruses to access critical content. Your company files are also vulnerable to insider threats. People with legitimate access to files could have malicious intent to leak them for financial gain or could fall victim to phishing scams.</p>
                        <p class="content" id="business">Cost is one of the most significant downsides of using an on-premises file storage solution. The initial setup costs are high because you need to purchase and install large servers and hardware to store your files. The size of these servers depends on your company's file storage needs. Running on-premises servers also requires an in-house IT team that can manage and mitigate any issues that arise.</p>
